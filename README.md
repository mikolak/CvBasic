CvBasic - DisCODe Component Library
===================================

Description
-----------

Basic OpenCV-based components, in most cases just wrappers.

Dependencies
------------

Depends on the CvCoreTypes DCL.
According to the current changes in the partial commercialization of the OpenCV, several CvBasic components (mainly encapsulating features such as SIFT, SURF, ORB etc.) require version 2.4.6.1.

Dataset
------------
Call __make dataset__ from the build directory in order to download and unrar the files required by exemplary tasks, e.g. SequenceViewer displays images from the data/opencv_classics folder.
